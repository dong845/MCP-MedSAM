# MCP-MedSAM

Pytorch Implementation of the paper "[MCP-MedSAM: A Powerful Lightweight Medical Segment Anything Model Trained with a Single GPU in Just One Day](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05888)". 

This paper introduces a new variant of lightweight MedSAM, integrating a pre-trained tiny ViT, two novel prompts (modality prompt and content prompt), and a modality-based data sampling strategy.

We are currently releasing the inference code along with the model weight. You can download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NW4aSNhk-dtiK-dicTAUp0g0eR2fryNi?usp=sharing).

The training code will be made available soon.
