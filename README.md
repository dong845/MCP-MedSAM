# MCP-MedSAM

Pytorch Implementation of the paper "[MCP-MedSAM: A Powerful Lightweight Medical Segment Anything Model Trained with a Single GPU in Just One Day](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05888)". This paper introduces a new variant of MedSAM, integrating a lightweight pre-trained tiny ViT, two novel prompts (modality prompt and content prompt), and a modality-based data sampling strategy. These enhancements enable the model to achieve strong performance without long training time and large GPU resource consumption. The code will come soon.
